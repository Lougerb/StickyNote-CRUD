<p>Before I made this project, I was inspired of the making of To-Do list.</p>
<p>Instead of making a project of to do list, I thought I want to make it more complicated.</p>
<p>This project was made from what I thought how it suppose to work, how I going to code instead of looking up for tutorials on youtube</p>

<h1>The Project</h1>
<h3>Sticky Notes</h3>
<p>Its process is simple:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a note to the editor</li>
  <li>When click "+" it will <b>READ</b> the note and generate/<b>CREATE</b> a new Note element with the note that was inputed</li>
  <li>On the generated Note, when clicking the "..." button, user can Edit and Delete the note.
    <ul>
      <li>Edit
         <ul>
            <li>When Clicking "Edit", the new generated Note element will create its own a Note editor and the user can edit the current note</li>
            <li>When user is in the editor, user can click "Save" in order to <b>UPDATE</b> the user's Note </li>
            <li>When user is in the editor, user can close the editor by clicking outside the editor</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Delete</b>
         <ul>
            <li>Clicking "Delete" will delete the parent Element of the current note and will wipeout the current note's contents</li>
